  Summary: >-
    This update has introduced another potential breaking change for your safety:
    zero length arrays now fail by default. Also errors inside subshells will
    cause the parent command to fail if ran inside a `try` or `trypipe` block.
  Description: |-
    ### Breaking Changes:
    
    * zero length arrays returned from subshells (eg `echo @{g this-file-does-not-exist}`) should fail by default, like unset variables. This is enabled by default but can be disabled via `config: set proc strict-arrays false`

    * autoglob should fail if it doesn't match any results. eg `@g echo this-file-does-not-exist.*`

    * Subshells should fail parent command when used inside `try` and `trypipe` blocks. eg `try { echo ${false} }`

    ### Features:

    * `function` now supports defining parameters
    
    * Added support fro `&&` eg `do-something && do-something-else` for chaining successful commands
    
    * Added support for `||` eg `do-something || do-something-else` for chaining unsuccessful commands
    
    * Added support for writing to the terminal emulator's titlebar via `config: set shell titlebar-func { block }`
    
    * `titlebar-func` can also be written to your `tmux` window title via `config: set shell tmux-echo true`.
    
    * New reserved variable: `$HOSTNAME`
    
    * New reserved variables: `$1` (and upwards) which correlates to the scope's parameter index. `$1` is the functions first parameter. `$2` is the second. `$13` is the thirteenth. 
    
    * New reserved variable: `$0` which contains the function name
    
    * New event: `onCommandCompletion` (this is experimental and subject to change in the next release)
    
    * Macro variables. eg `echo Hello ^$name` will prompt the user to enter a name. Macro variables are only support in the REPL
    
    * `read` now supports flags (eg default option, etc) to allow for a better experience in shell scripting

    ### Minor Changes:

    * You can now overwrite `onKeyPress` events. This no longer produces an error forcing you to remove the old event before adding the new one
    
    * Autocompletion suggestions shouldn't be sorted is results include paths (improves the ordering of autocompletion suggestions)
    
    * Autocompletion suggestions for `openagent` builtin
    
    * Autocompletion suggestions for hashtags
    
    * Test counts re-added to website
    
    * Windows should show file extensions by default in autocompletion results

    ### Bug Fixes:

    * Fix inverted logic on `forceTTY`: `config: get proc force-tty false` set by default, which then proxies stderr and prints them in red
    
    * ctrl+c (^c) now currectly sends SIGTERM rather than just ending the child process
    
    * Better handling of SIGTERM
    
    * SIGTSTP isn't working. Switched to SIGSTOP when  (^z) doesn't 
    
    * Fix panic in event `onFilesystemChange` where fileRef is not getting passed correctly
    
    * Fix panic in event `onFilesystemChange` where path is zero length string
    
    * Some improvements to variable previews in the REPL
    
    * `count` should check if it is a method
    
    * AST cache now checked more regukarly. This is to reduce the risk of memory leaks during fuzz or load testing
    
    * `murex-docs` still referred to `len` builtin. That should be changed to `count`
    
    * Lots of fuzzing added -- a few edge case bugs discovered
