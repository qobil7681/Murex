    v4.3
  CategoryID: changelog
  DateTime: 2023-07-02 09:55
  Summary: >-
    This brings improved support on Windows plus one breaking change from the previous release (v4.2)
  Description: |-
    ## Breaking Changes

    * `pre-prompt-func` and `post-prompt-func` have been replaced with `onPrompt` events: `event onKeyPress example=before { ... }`

    * The `onFileSystemChange` event payload now lowercases the filesystem event operation string. However until this release, that payload was undocumented ([read more](https://murex.rocks/events/onfilesystemchange.html))

    ## Features

    * New events, `onPrompt`, triggered when the interactive prompt is at various stages

    * **Dynamic** and **DynamicDesc** autocompletions can have their partial term prefix filter disabled ([read more](https://murex.rocks/commands/autocomplete.html#ignoreprefix-boolean-false), [previous discussion](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/635))

    * New autocompletions: `gping`

    ## Bug Fixes

    * Improved Windows support. Arrow keys and other special keys are now handled correctly ([#630](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/issues/630))

    * Fix `ctrl`+`a` offset by 1 error ([#628](https://github.com/lmorg/murex/pull/628))
